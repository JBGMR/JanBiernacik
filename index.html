</center>
        <p style="color:#FFFFFF";>ON MY INSTAGRAM: I shoot pictures of Poland and Germany. Most of them are Landscapes and waters. My pictures are all shot with a mobile phone. More specifically a Galaxy A50.
         This phone has a decent camera that fits my needs. All of my photos are on Instagram and some of them are on Facebook. I am interested in tech and play Tennis. I am also a Gamer. Currently I am learning C and soon C++.
	My first program is useless, but available in the Downloads. Currently it is only available in german.

		 <h1>Plans for the future</h1>
		 <p>Build a PC - Get a new monitor - Improve my YT channel - Work on this website - Work on other code - learn a proper programming language (html is
			 not a proper programming language) - make a linux distro - go to a tech event (like WWDC or the samsung keynote) - visit Gamescom - 
                         Maybe build my own OS?</p>
		 <p>If you ask yourself "Why didn't he put some big plans on this list?": Even though I'm a 13yo kiddo, who doesn't speak english properly,
			 I always think realistic. I don't plan on getting super rich and opening 50 businesses, because I know, that that is almost impossible (for now).
		 <h1>GitHub</h1>
		 <p>I upload every type of code on GitHub. Most of the Software is just useless but there is also good code like the Safe Debloater. You can also find the
			 source code of this website on GitHub (read license first) as well as the source code of my Android Web App of which the APK is in the downloads
			 section. If you want to reupload the code I wrote,
			 message me first. If you didn't make any changes, forget about it.

		 <h1>Donations</h1>
		 <p>I don't have Patreon or something. But I'd be really happy if you donate a custom domain. Having this GitHub domain feels kinda unprofessional.
			 Note: I don't try to be professional :P.</p>

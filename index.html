	 <h3 style="color:#82cdff";>More about me:</h3>
</center>
        <p style="color:#FFFFFF";>I'm a 13 year old polish guy who likes to break devices. I broke 3 phones and 1 PC in 2020. When I'm bored, I write batch files, that most of the time will ruin your pc.
	 I also have a YouTube channel but I'm not very active. In my free time I play Tennis and do shooting with my air rifle. I also do E-Sport. I am a big Samsung fan.
	 You may or may not hate me for that. I just prefer Android over iOS. I used to be a Linux user but due to problems with my computer, I'm stuck with Windows.
	 The idea for this Website came out of nowhere. I knew some html basics, so I decided to open one. I just couldn't find a good place to host it. Then I came across
	 GitHub pages. Not ideal, but almost perfect for a noob like me. So i learnt how to use CSS and also a little bit more html and BOOM! Here we are. I have to say
	 html is the easiest language I've ever tried.</p>

		 <h1>Plans for the future</h1>
		 <p>Build a PC - Get a new monitor - Improve my YT channel - Work on this Website - Work on other code - learn a proper programming language (html is
			 not a proper programming language) - make a linux distro - go to a tech event (like WWDC or the samsung keynote) - visit Gamescom - 
                         Maybe build my own OS?</p>
		 <p>If you ask yourself "Why didn't he put some big plans on this list?": Even though I'm a 13yo kiddo, who doesn't speak english properly,
			 I always think realistic. I don't plan on getting super rich and opening 50 businesses, because I know, that that is almost impossible (for now).
		 <h1>GitHub</h1>
		 <p>I upload evry type of code on GitHub. Most of the Software is just useless but there is also good code like the Safe Debloater. You can also find the
			 source code of this website on GitHub (read license first) as well as the source code of my Android Web App of which the APK is in the downloads
			 section. If you want to reupload the code I wrote,
			 message me first. If you didn't make any changes, forget about it.</p>
		 <h1>Donations</h1>
		 <p>I don't have Patreon or something. But I'd be really happy if you donate a custom domain. Having this GitHub domain feels kinda unprofessional.
			 Note: I don't try to be professional :P.</p>
			   <h1>Info</h1>

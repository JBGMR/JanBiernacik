    <p>I closed my website today. I want to completely rebuild and redesign it. I am also working on an app to improve the mobile experience. It will only be available on Android
        as I have no idea how to make iOS apps. Yes i did use sketchware please don't cancel me on twitter lmao. The app is the "big thing" I am working on. People reading this
        after february will have no idea why I called it the "big thing" haha. I also hope that the time I waste on this website is worth it and I get more visitors. This whole
        thing is non-profit but I still am happy when someone visits my website.
